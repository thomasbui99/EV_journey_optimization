# Optimization of a the journey of an electric vehicle

This project consists in minimizing the travel time of an electric car on an highway, by selecting at which charging stations to stop and for how long. We consider constant waiting times at each station. The problem is solved in the code file *optimization_charging_stations.py*. We use two strategies:
- brute force, which is slow but deterministic and returns the optimal travel
- simulated annealing, which is faster but does not give an exact result.
